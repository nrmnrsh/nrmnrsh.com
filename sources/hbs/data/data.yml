    There many other projects on GitHub which are not listed here. So if you're
    interested in some more projects take a look at my GitHub profile page.
  projects:
  - name: Lintspaces
    details: Lintspaces or better ”node-lintspaces” is a javascript module for
      checking different types of spaces in a source code. It validates a lot of
      different types like indentation, trailing whitespace, new line at end of
      file and some more. It respects team or project settings defined in
      .editorconfig and/or .lintspacesrc. ”node-linstpaces” is the core which
      other open source tools like ”lintspaces-cli” by Evan Shortiss,
      ”gulp-lintspaces” by Alberto Elias and ”grunt-lintspaces” are based on.

      validation module.

  - name: Picnic
    details: Depending on the stack we use at an agency called Moccu based in
      berlin, this is a set of common front end features. These features are
      things like an overlay, accordion or different kind of media players such
      as core features to render templates and data in the given technology
      stack and more complex user flows like an ajax-based user page navigation.
      The stack requires the mv* framework backbone.js enhanced with a command
      framework called backbone.geppetto.

  projects:
  - name: privée
    client: L’ORÉAL PARiS
    details: "A relaunch of the CRM plattform by L’ORÉAL PARiS called ”privée”.
      The first release was in 2013. Members can collect points called ”Beauty
      Stars” by performing activities like polls and productreviews. Those
      gained points can be redeemed for products in a ”shop”. This relaunch was
      a technical and graphical chance for a new beginning. We ported the
      previous features to the new plattform and added new features like fully
      configurable surveys forms based on JSON schema and receipt uploads. Under
      the hood we prepared the website for the usage of service workers and PWA
      support."

  - name: Eventmodules
    note: for Olympia 2016 in Rio & UEFA 2016
    client: ZDF
    details: "A data driven video plattform for two of the big sports events in
      2016 – the summer olympics and the UEFA european championship. This
      website containes ticker- and teaserlists which uses a polling mechanism
      for an automatic update. The user can use the website as second screen and
      gets all informations with livestreams, latest news around certain sports,
      teams or matches and the possebility to repeat importent scenes. The
      plattform also contains an api to embed third party sport widgets. An
      other nice feature is the singlepage navigation which enables page changes
      using ”history api” and ”push/pop states” for an animated change between
      to pages. This feature later on was backported to the open source picnic
      library."

  - name: Mauerspecht
    client: ZDF
    details: "In 2014, the fall of the Berlin Wall celebrated the 25th
      anniversary. This great moment in the german history was an opening for
      the ZDF to tear down the wall again using social media. The developed
      plattform shows a 160km long wall. The user can scroll along the wall with
      a lot of well known graffiti on it. The plattform aggregates tweets and
      posts from facebook or instagram using a certain hastag. Each posting
      demolishes the wall. At the end, the required amount of social media
      postings wasn't reached to tear down the wall completely, but the campaign
      itself was a total success. Back in 2014 there were no widely supported
      WebGL rendering support (especially on mobile browsers) for the 3d
      animation of the berlin wall. So I needed to implement a render algorithm
      for canvas 2d, based on the ”ray tracing” algorithm."
