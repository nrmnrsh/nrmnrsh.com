  copy: This is a list of some of my open source projects and contributions. There
    many other projects on GitHub which are not listed here. So if you're interested
    in some more projects take a look at my GitHub profile page.
  projects:
  - name: Lintspaces
    details: Lintspaces or better ”node-lintspaces” is a javascript module for checking
      different types of spaces in a source code. It validates a lot of different
      types like indentation, trailing whitespace, new line at end of file and some
      more. It respects team or project settings defined in .editorconfig and/or .lintspacesrc.
      ”node-linstpaces” is the core which other open source tools like ”lintspaces-cli”
      by Evan Shortiss, ”gulp-lintspaces” by Alberto Elias and ”grunt-lintspaces”
      are based on.

      module.

  - name: Picnic
    details: Depending on the stack we use at an agency called Moccu based in berlin,
      this is a set of common front end features. These features are things like an
      overlay, accordion or different kind of media players such as core features
      to render templates and data in the given technology stack and more complex
      user flows like an ajax-based user page navigation. The stack requires the mv*
      framework backbone.js enhanced with a command framework called backbone.geppetto.
